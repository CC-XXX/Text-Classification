# Text-Classification
AML Final Project


We are using 3 types of modes: CNN, RNN, HAN to operate the text and varify their classification.

After that, we optimize our models, and apply it to other datasets, such as yelp and steam game comments.

Besides, we also apply the model on Chinese text and develop an automatic spider for crawling news from Chinese famous news platform everyday.
