# Text-Classification
AML Final Project


We are using 3 types of modes: CNN, RNN, HAN to operate the text and varify their classification.

After that, we optimize our models, and apply it to other datasets, such as yelp and steam game comments.

Except for models themselves, we also combine rules to improve the performance of them.

Lastly, we change the CNN model to apply to Chinese text with multiple classes and develop an automatic spider for crawling news from Chinese famous news platform everyday.

PS. ROC figures only show the former 10000 results since the whole data sets are too large to show.
